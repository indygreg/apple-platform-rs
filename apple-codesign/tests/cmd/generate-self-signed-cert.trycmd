$ rcodesign generate-self-signed-certificate --help
Generate a self-signed certificate that can be used for code signing.

This command will generate a new key pair using the algorithm of choice
then create an X.509 certificate wrapper for it that is signed with the
just-generated private key. The created X.509 certificate has extensions
that mark it as appropriate for code signing.

Certificates generated with this command can be useful for local testing.
However, because it is a self-signed certificate and isn't signed by a
trusted certificate authority, Apple operating systems may refuse to
load binaries signed with it.

By default the command prints 2 PEM encoded blocks. One block is for the
X.509 public certificate. The other is for the PKCS#8 private key (which
can include the public key).

The `--pem-filename` argument can be specified to write the generated
certificate pair to a pair of files. The destination files will have
`.crt` and `.key` appended to the value provided.

When the certificate is written to a file, it isn't printed to stdout.
