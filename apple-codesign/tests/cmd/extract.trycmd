$ rcodesign help extract
Extract code signature data from a Mach-O binary.

Given the path to a Mach-O binary (including fat/universal) binaries, this
command will parse and print requested data to stdout.

The --data argument controls which data to extract and how to print it.
Possible values are:

blobs
   Low-level information on the records in the embedded code signature.
cms-info
   Print important information about the CMS data structure.
cms-pem
   Like cms-raw except it prints PEM encoded data, which is ASCII and
   safe to print to terminals.
cms-raw
   Print the payload of the CMS blob. This should be well-formed BER
   encoded ASN.1 data. (This will print binary to stdout.)
cms
   Print the ASN.1 decoded CMS data.
code-directory-raw
   Raw binary data composing the code directory data structure.
code-directory
   Information on the main code directory data structure.
code-directory-serialized
   Reserialize the parsed code directory, parse it again, and then print
   it like `code-directory` would.
code-directory-serialized-raw
   Reserialize the parsed code directory and emit its binary. Useful
   for comparing round-tripping of code directory data.
linkedit-info
   Information about the __LINKEDIT Mach-O segment in the binary.
linkedit-segment-raw
   Complete content of the __LINKEDIT Mach-O segment as binary.
macho-load-commands
   Print information about mach-o load commands in the binary.
macho-segments
   Print information about mach-o segments in the binary.
macho-target
   Print mach-o targeting info (platform and OS/SDK versions).
requirements-raw
   Raw binary data composing the requirements blob/slot.
requirements
   Parsed code requirement statement/expression.
requirements-rust
   Dump the internal Rust data structures representing the requirements
   expressions.
requirements-serialized
   Reserialize the code requirements blob, parse it again, and then
   print it like `requirements` would.
requirements-serialized-raw
   Reserialize the code requirements blob and emit its binary.
signature-raw
   Raw binary data composing the signature data embedded in the binary.
superblob
   The SuperBlob record and high-level details of embedded Blob
   records, including digests of every Blob.


Usage: rcodesign[EXE] extract [OPTIONS] <path>

Arguments:
  <path>
          Path to Mach-O binary to examine

Options:
      --data <data>
          Which data to extract and how to format it
          
          [default: linkedit-info]
          [possible values: blobs, cms-info, cms-pem, cms-raw, cms, code-directory-raw, code-directory-serialized-raw, code-directory-serialized, code-directory, linkedit-info, linkedit-segment-raw, macho-load-commands, macho-segments, macho-target, requirements-raw, requirements-rust, requirements-serialized-raw, requirements-serialized, requirements, signature-raw, superblob]

  -v, --verbose...
          Increase logging verbosity. Can be specified multiple times.

      --universal-index <universal_index>
          Index of Mach-O binary to operate on within a universal/fat binary
          
          [default: 0]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
