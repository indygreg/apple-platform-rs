$ rcodesign help sign
Adds code signatures to a signable entity.

This command can sign the following entities:

* A single Mach-O binary (specified by its file path)
* A bundle (specified by its directory path)
* A DMG disk image (specified by its path)
* A XAR archive (commonly a .pkg installer file)

If the input is Mach-O binary, it can be a single or multiple/fat/universal
Mach-O binary. If a fat binary is given, each Mach-O within that binary will
be signed.

If the input is a bundle, the bundle will be recursively signed. If the
bundle contains nested bundles or Mach-O binaries, those will be signed
automatically.

# Settings Scope

The following signing settings are global and apply to all signed entities:

* --digest
* --pem-source
* --team-name
* --timestamp-url

The following signing settings can be scoped so they only apply to certain
entities:

* --binary-identifier
* --code-requirements-path
* --code-resources-path
* --code-signature-flags
* --entitlements-xml-path
* --info-plist-path

Scoped settings take the form <value> or <scope>:<value>. If the 2nd form
is used, the string before the first colon is parsed as a "scoping string".
It can have the following values:

* `main` - Applies to the main entity being signed and all nested entities.
* `@<integer>` - e.g. `@0`. Applies to a Mach-O within a fat binary at the
  specified index. 0 means the first Mach-O in a fat binary.
* `@[cpu_type=<int>` - e.g. `@[cpu_type=7]`. Applies to a Mach-O within a fat
  binary targeting a numbered CPU architecture (using numeric constants
  as defined by Mach-O).
* `@[cpu_type=<string>` - e.g. `@[cpu_type=x86_64]`. Applies to a Mach-O within
  a fat binary targeting a CPU architecture identified by a string. See below
  for the list of recognized values.
* `<string>` - e.g. `path/to/file`. Applies to content at a given path. This
  should be the bundle-relative path to a Mach-O binary, a nested bundle, or
  a Mach-O binary within a nested bundle. If a nested bundle is referenced,
  settings apply to everything within that bundle.
* `<string>@<int>` - e.g. `path/to/file@0`. Applies to a Mach-O within a
  fat binary at the given path. If the path is to a bundle, the setting applies
  to all Mach-O binaries in that bundle.
* `<string>@[cpu_type=<int|string>]` e.g. `Contents/MacOS/binary@[cpu_type=7]`
  or `Contents/MacOS/binary@[cpu_type=arm64]`. Applies to a Mach-O within a
  fat binary targeting a CPU architecture identified by its integer constant
  or string name. If the path is to a bundle, the setting applies to all
  Mach-O binaries in that bundle.

The following named CPU architectures are recognized:

* arm
* arm64
* arm64_32
* x86_64

Signing will traverse into nested entities:

* A fat Mach-O binary will traverse into the multiple Mach-O binaries within.
* A bundle will traverse into nested bundles.
* A bundle will traverse non-code "resource" files and sign their digests.
* A bundle will traverse non-main Mach-O binaries and sign them, adding their
  metadata to the signed resources file.

# Bundle Signing Overrides Settings

When signing bundles, some settings specified on the command line will be
ignored. This is to ensure that the produced signing data is correct. The
settings ignored include (but may not be limited to):

* --binary-identifier for the main executable. The `CFBundleIdentifier` value
  from the bundle's `Info.plist` will be used instead.
* --code-resources-path. The code resources data will be computed automatically
  as part of signing the bundle.
* --info-plist-path. The `Info.plist` from the bundle will be used instead.
* --digest and --extra-digest

# Designated Code Requirements

When using Apple issued code signing certificates, we will attempt to apply
an appropriate designated requirement automatically during signing which
matches the behavior of what `codesign` would do. We do not yet support all
signing certificates and signing targets for this, however. So you may
need to provide your own requirements.

Designated code requirements can be specified via --code-requirements-path.

This file MUST contain a binary/compiled code requirements expression. We do
not (yet) support parsing the human-friendly code requirements DSL. A
binary/compiled file can be produced via Apple's `csreq` tool. e.g.
`csreq -r '=<expression>' -b /output/path`. If code requirements data is
specified, it will be parsed and displayed as part of signing to ensure it
is well-formed.

# Code Signing Key Pair

By default, the embedded code signature will only contain digests of the
binary and other important entities (such as entitlements and resources).
This is often referred to as "ad-hoc" signing.

To use a code signing key/certificate to derive a cryptographic signature,
you must specify a source certificate to use. This can be done in the following
ways:

* The --p12-file denotes the location to a PFX formatted file. These are
  often .pfx or .p12 files. A password is required to open these files.
  Specify one via --p12-password or --p12-password-file or enter a password
  when prompted.
* The --pem-source argument defines paths to files containing PEM encoded
  certificate/key data. (e.g. files with "===== BEGIN CERTIFICATE =====").
* The --source-source argument defines paths to files containiner DER
  encoded certificate/key data.
* The --keychain-domain and --keychain-fingerprint arguments can be used to
  load code signing certificates from macOS keychains. These arguments are
  ignored on non-macOS platforms.
* The --smartcard-slot argument defines the name of a slot in a connected
  smartcard device to read from. `9c` is common.
* Arguments beginning with --remote activate *remote signing mode* and can
  be used to delegate cryptographic signing operations to a separate machine.
  It is strongly advised to read the user documentation on remote signing
  mode at https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/apple-codesign/main/.

If you export a code signing certificate from the macOS keychain via the
`Keychain Access` application as a .p12 file, we should be able to read these
files via --p12-file.

When using --pem-source, certificates and public keys are parsed from
`BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY` sections in the files.

The way certificate discovery works is that --p12-file is read followed by
all values to --pem-source. The seen signing keys and certificates are
collected. After collection, there must be 0 or 1 signing keys present, or
an error occurs. The first encountered public certificate is assigned
to be paired with the signing key. All remaining certificates are assumed
to constitute the CA issuing chain and will be added to the signature
data to facilitate validation.

If you are using an Apple-issued code signing certificate, we detect this
and automatically register the Apple CA certificate chain so it is included
in the digital signature. This matches the behavior of the `codesign` tool.

For best results, put your private key and its corresponding X.509 certificate
in a single file, either a PFX or PEM formatted file. Then add any additional
certificates constituting the signing chain in a separate PEM file.

When using a code signing key/certificate, a Time-Stamp Protocol server URL
can be specified via --timestamp-url. By default, Apple's server is used. The
special value "none" can disable using a timestamp server.

# Selecting What to Sign

By default, this command attempts to recursively sign everything in the source
path. This applies to:

* Bundles. If the specified bundle has nested bundles, those nested bundles
  will be signed automatically.

It is possible to exclude nested items from signing using --exclude. This
argument takes a glob expression that matches *relative paths* from the
source path. Glob expressions can be literal string compares. Or the
following special syntax is recognized:

* `?` matches any single character.
* `*` matches any (possibly empty) sequence of characters.
* `**` matches the current directory and arbitrary subdirectories. This sequence
  must form a single path component, so both **a and b** are invalid and will
  result in an error. A sequence of more than two consecutive * characters is
  also invalid.
* `[...]` matches any character inside the brackets. Character sequences can also
  specify ranges of characters, as ordered by Unicode, so e.g. [0-9] specifies any
  character between 0 and 9 inclusive. An unclosed bracket is invalid.
* `[!...]` is the negation of `[...]`, i.e. it matches any characters not in the
  brackets.
* The metacharacters `?`, `*`, `[`, `]` can be matched by using brackets (e.g.
  `[?]`). When a `]` occurs immediately following `[` or `[!` then it is
  interpreted as being part of, rather then ending, the character set, so `]` and
  `NOT ]` can be matched by `[]]` and `[!]]` respectively. The `-` character can
  be specified inside a character sequence pattern by placing it at the start or
  the end, e.g. `[abc-]`.

Currently, --exclude only applies to the relative path of nested bundles within
the main bundle to sign. e.g. if you sign `MyApp.app` and it has a
`Contents/Frameworks/MyFramework.framework` that you wish to exclude, you would
`--exclude Contents/Frameworks/MyFramework.framework` or even
`--exclude Contents/Frameworks/**` to exclude the entire directory tree.

Exclusions will still be copied and parents that need to reference exclude
entities will continue to do so. If you wish to make a file or directory
disappear, create a new directory without the file(s) and sign that.

To exclude all nested bundles from being signed and only sign the main bundle
(the default behavior of ``codesign`` without ``--deep``), use `--exclude '**'`.
