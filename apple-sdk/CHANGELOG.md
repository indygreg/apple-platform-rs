# apple-sdk Crate Changelog

<!-- next-header -->

## Unreleased

Released on ReleaseDate.

* XROS support. `Platform` enumeration added `XrOs` and `XrOsSimulator`
  variants. The `aarch64-apple-xros-sim` and `*-apple-xros` triples are
  now recognized as XROS.
* The developer directory configured with `xcode-select --switch PATH` can now
  be retrieved by using `DeveloperDirectory::from_xcode_select_paths`, and
  this is done by default when searching for SDKs.

## 0.5.2

Released on 2023-12-22.

* Fixed repository URL in README.md.

## 0.5.1

Released on 2023-11-09.

## 0.5.0

Released on 2023-11-06.

* Change `PlatformDirectory` and `SdkVersion` `partial_cmp()` to be
  implemented in terms of `cmp()`. Should have no visible effects.

## 0.4.0

## 0.3.0

* Document that `SdkSearchLocation::SdkRootEnv` bypasses SDK filtering.
* Add `Platform::from_target_triple()`. (#1)
